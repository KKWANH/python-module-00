***GOAL***: This project aims to you to learn basic stuffs about **Python** with 11 questions.

## Instructions
- **Version**
  - Recommended python version is 3.7.
  - You can check the version of python with `python -V` command.
- **Norm** that no one likes
  - Ok. here, you can see that the NORM that made all of us painful before is back.
  - It is recommended to follow the [**`PEP 8 standards`**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
  - Check is your code with [`pycodestyle`](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/). 
- function `eval` is never allowed.
- The exercies are ordered from the easiest to the hardest, please keep the order.
- Best manual or the colleague is **Google**(or chatGPT, whatever *`<;`* ).
- You can ask questions in [42AI](https://app.slack.com/client/T3T7KSKE3)/[42born2code](https://app.slack.com/client/T039P7U66)'s `#bootcamps` channel.
- Any mistakes or issues? Please report 'em in [42AI's Github Channel Issue](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_python/issues).
- The project encourage you to create test programs just like old-push-swap. This means you will not be graded with the test program exists or not.

## Exercise 04

|----|----|

|Required File|
|----|
|`operations.py`|

Write a program that takes two integers A and B as arguments and prints the result of the following operation:

```shell
Sum:        A+B
Difference: A-B
Product:    A*B
Quotient:   A/B
Remainder:  A%B
```
